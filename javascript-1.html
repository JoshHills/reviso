                        You see that light on the horizon? You’ve finally made it to the end-of-the-line, and there’s no better topic in which to go out with a bang. Here, I’ll provide a brief run-down of the last building-block composing modern websites, which adds the last key step of functionality- interactivity. JavaScript Is a broad subject to cover, and can be looked at on a microcosmic scale if such a thing took your fancy. For the purposes of revision, I’ll touch on the most important relevent elements, such as how to include it in your website, what it does on a basic level, and then provide some catalysts for further reading. Are you <a class="peekable">excited</a><span>i'm excited!!</span><span></span>?                    
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
                
                <div class="key-points right">
                
                    <table class="points">
                    
                            <tr><td>JavaScript is the last piece of the puzzle.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>It enables a greater depth of interaction for the users of your website.</td></tr>
                            <tr><td>The possibilities are endless, and as a result there's a lot to know.</td></tr>  
                        
                    </table>
                
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a scripting language that executes <em>in</em> your Web Browser- it is embedded in your files, and has many favourable features for web-development; it’s <a class="peekable">dynamically typed</a><span>this makes it very relaxed, which is both a curse and a blessing as debugging can be hard to get to grips with</span><span></span>, meaning you  don’t have to specify what kinds of variables you are creating. It was introduced from a <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript" target="_blank">dualistic background of development</a> by both <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Sun</strong>, and allows a user to interact with the DOM.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is incredibly important, as it transforms your now pretty-looking, relatively static web-pages into applications. At a basic level, like other programming-languages, you can create variables and logical constructs, as well as functions; what you do inside these is literally limitless- you can register event-listeners to react to changes in the web-page, which may encompass anything from creating a game to processing form <a class="peekable">informaton</a><span>quite effectively too, with tools such as ‘<a href="javascript-1.html#regex" target="_self">regex</a>’</span><span></span>.
                </p>

                <pre><code id="javascript-1-1-example" class="load inline-code"></code></pre>
                
                <input type="button" name="alerter" value="onclick='exampleFunction()'" onclick="exampleFunction()" />

            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box">
            
                <h3>Gimme!</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Similar to CSS, including javascript in your website can be done by actually including the code in your document’s <a class="peekable">head</a><span>to load before the dom loads</span><span></span> or <a class="peekable">body</a><span>to load after the body has loaded</span><span></span> using <code class="inline-code">&lt;script&gt;</code> tags, however it’s better practice, especially with larger files, to link to them externally:
                </p>
                
                <code class="inline-code">&lt;script src=&quot;scripts/sections/javascript-1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
                
                <p>
                    <em>You can see a bunch of intialisation scripts loaded into this page in the source!</em>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    As for interacting with your code, you can output to the console with<code class="inline-code"> console.log(string);</code>, and actually run functions by <a class="peekable">name</a><span>running using parentheses, and retrieiving the literal function-as-string by omitting them</span><span></span>. If you want to take a look at the javascript model of your user-profile (and even tweak it, you cheater), you can type ‘user’ into the console and mess with the object it returns!
                </p>
            
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box">
            
                <h3>DOM Interaction:</h3>
                
                <div id="javascript-1-1" class="question right"></div>
                
                <p>
                    Being able to navigate through the DOM in javascript is kindred to navigating your computer’s filesystem using the terminal, only slightly more confusing.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Without necessarily knowing the direct route to an element via the heirarchy, there are several functions you should memorise (they're all pretty self-explanatory):
                </p>
                
                <p><code class="inline-code">document.getElementById()</code></p>
                <p><code class="inline-code">document.getElementsByClassName()</code></p>
                <p><code class="inline-code">document.getElementsByName()</code></p>
                <p><code class="inline-code">document.getElementsByTagName()</code></p>
                
                <p>
                    The query selector lets you use CSS-style targeting to find and return elements:
                </p>
                
                <p><code class="inline-code">document.querySelector()</code></p>
                
                <hr />
                
                <p>
                    <em>A more comprehensive list <a href="http://javascript.info/tutorial/traversing-dom" target="_blank">can be found here</a>!</em>
                </p>
            
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box demo-box">
                
                <h3>Regular Expressions:</h3>
                
                <p>
                    These provide a standardised method of pattern matching for text- they’re like search criteria to draw substrings from content in JavaScript- they are usful in validation. To construct a ‘regexp’, you concoct a string of <a href="http://www.debuggex.com/cheatsheet/regex/javascript" target="_blank">meta-characters</a> that have specific meanings, best outlined in the cheat-sheet here. Now you know of their existence, when you inevitable come across a reason to use them you should know of a means to solve your problem!
                </p>
                
            </div>
            
            <div class="content-box-anecdote">
            
                <h3>Graceful Degradation:</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Having meandered over some quick basics of JavaScript, we should take that backseat to chat about good practices. The big issue with including script-functionality in a web-page is that it shouldn’t be dependent upon it if you still want to convey information alongside it- this is because, if it breaks or there are any compatibility issues from your users, it will not degrade helpfully! By scripting <a class="peekable">practically</a><span>using tools wisely, adopting other frameworks...</span><span></span>, you should foster unobtrusive code that lends itself well to graceful degradation.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is especially important when utilising <a class="peekable">plugins</a><span>other people's code-libraries that do useful jobs for you</span><span></span>, as they aren't maintained by you- you never know when something could go wrong!
                </p>
