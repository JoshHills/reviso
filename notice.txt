'Reviso' Attributations:

The intended purpose of this website is to educate and inform. As such, the usage of
minimal elements of the website, such as select graphics which have been used to aid
visual learning and emphasise key points, fall within the scope of the fair use provision
of the 'Copyright Act of 1976'- they originate chiefly at 'Flickr'.

As an honourable mention, the general look-and-feel of the website has been influenced
by that of another educational web-application in a similar vein, 'Duolingo'.

The following spew of legal information prepends a brief explanation as to the extent
each resource was employed...

- jQuery Copyright © 2015, The jQuery Foundation - Licensed under: MIT License (found above)

I have used the 'jQuery' plug-in to allow for more efficient, readable javascript that
can interact fluidly with the webpage.

I have used the 'Highlightjs' plugin, as the alternative would have been to write my
own near-identical set of 'regex' functions to highlight and discern code-content;
this would defeat the point!

- SimpleStore Polyfill 'Gist', 2013, Kent Safranski.

I have used Safranski's fallback for browser local storage as it provides a simple, concise method of accessing
local files that alleviated my cross-browser compatibility problems.

See 'license' for 'Reviso's general licensing.

'Reviso' was developed for a project for the University of Newcastle, under a
'web-development' module of a computer science course.

This information, along with relevant links, can also be found on the 'about' page of the website.
