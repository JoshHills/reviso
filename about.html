                        The purpose of this website, devoid of any marketing patter, is simple: we want to help you learn the things you're going to need to learn! We offer a web-related technology course, which aims to take you on a magical journey through the syllabus, visiting the wondrous lands of both design and implementation. The aim is to inspire you to discover more about the subject while silmulatenously establishing a basic skillset to enable you to do so. We hope you enjoy your stay, and take advantage of your statistical progress checking via the tests available to bolster your revision effort. Don't fail!

                    Choose a topic to start with (preferably one you're interested in, need to revise, and which relfects your current level of understanding). In the topic, a progress bar will track your completion of the questions of each page, which themselves reference the content. This should test your memory, and help with the whole <em>exam</em> thing you having going on. Capiche? Great. Try the question below, just to make sure you have that locked down.

                <p>
                    The information provided in each section meanders from the basics to the downright obscure, just to expand your palate- you're not a web developer if you haven't grappled the horns of CSS transitions or sulked in defeat at a browser's inability to run your script. I've tried to freshen it up by seperating the content nicely. Also, wherever relevant I've provided example code snippets, which have been automagically <strong>highlighted</strong> to discern between key words- <code class="inline-code">should make this easier for you</code>!
                </p>

                <p>                
                    Lastly, I've tried supplement the website's content with additional features to aid your user experience- ain't I nice? The website boasts, alongside its user profile tracking, <a class="peekable">tooltips</a><span>Which were a nightmare to construct by the way- you're welcome.</span><span></span> to provide meta information about the subject, an alert bar to give you helpful handy hints (and patronise you, you know, for motivation), as well as a fully fleshed out navigational system and design that, if you're not already crying tears of joy right now, should have you weeping by the fourth or fifth page.

                    this would defeat the point!
